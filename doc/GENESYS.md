#Setting up Genesys node

Setting up genesys is divided into 2 easy steps. First you need to setup authentication, then you can add your node to the pool.

## Authentication
Genesys authentication is using our plugin system, so every config attribute related to it is using lowercase.
- client_id should be your genesys client id, be aware that it's currently displayed on dashboard so please ensure it's not accessible to public
- pk is your wallet private key, for **phantom wallet** you can export by clicking top-left icon, then `security and privacy`->`export private key`

<code>
... "plugin-genesys": {"client_id":"c26fe6*","pk": "4rZGkEjJ8qcF*"} ...
</code>

Then you need to start solproxy. If everything's right you should see following message, which will contain updated config you should replace for production to not store your private key.

<pre>
Warning: You should copy genesys plugin config from below for production, to not store unencrypted PK
------------------------------------------------------------------
{"client_id":"c26fe6*","msg":"3rYuxoyygKo*",
"public_key":"2PQuSo*"}
------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

Notes:
- Private key allows anyone to access your funds, so you should enter your configuration only locally, then on production you should only use the configuration settings generated by solproxy
- For additional security never use your main wallet, always create a new, empty one

## Adding node
Finally you can add your genesys node normally. Authentication will be matched by your client_id
